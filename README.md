# Colmar Academy Project
  The purpose of this project was completing an assignment from Codeacademy. The project is for a fictional website about an educational institution: Colmar Academy
  and its landing page. 
    It's intended for developmental purposes regarding my skills. 
  I have published it onto github for critic/feedback from more advanced and experienced working developers: I would like feedback on my work 
  to reach a suitable standard in order to start working as a freelance-developer.
  
  Current Build Status
  The website is very similiar to the blueprint/reference layout. 
  
  - Regarding colour, namely the shades of grey; I have tweaked other colors too in general and shifted certain elements minutely veering off the blueprint illustration.
  
  - My biggest issue throughout was the left margin throughout the page (literal white space), by default it seemed to have a larger left margin consequenting in a horizontal 
    scroll bar, which was unintended. I don't know how to fix this.
  
  - Font: I haven't exactly hit the target matching the blueprint with font-family, Verdana and Tahoma were the closest I got regarding headings and titles in dark grey. 
  
  Code Style

  Tech
  Visual Studio Code was used to complete this project.
  
  Installation
  To install Visual Studio Code and view/access my project in real time, navigate to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and click download. 
  
  - Create a folder for this website on your computer from file explore (remember where you've placed it).
  
  - Click on/open V.S. Code, once open, click "open folder" and select the folder you just created.
  
  - On the left toolbar, create a file(folded paper icon) and label it html.
  
  - In the same toolbar, click on the folder icon to create a folder called resources.
  
  - Create another folder called CSS.
  
  - Then create another - file - called CSS inside the CSS folder.
  
  - Lastly create a folder called images (download the ones in the images folder: https://github.com/Johannes-Harald/Colmar/tree/main/resources/images) and transport them into 
    the images folder you have created in V.S. Code: this is to be done from your file-explorer, off of V.S. Code.
    
   Lastly
   
   - Copy the html code from Colmar for this project off github and paste it in the html tab in V.S. Code copy the CSS from github and paste it in the CSS tab.
   
   - Navigate to file and click save.
   
   - Right click on the html file and copy path and paste the link into a browser omnibox to view the website.
